And also our service when we offer you direct booking on our website (for selected ticket types and operators).
Our terms and conditions do, however, not apply to the conditions under which the mediated transports or travels are carried out, therefore the terms and conditions of the relevant travel provider or operator apply. Our terms and conditions also do not apply to the conditions under which you book the tickets on a third-party booking site, even if we have referred you to this site. In this case, the respective terms and conditions of the provider of such booking sites do apply.

<h3><b><u>Eazzer Service</u></b></h3><br/>
<div style="text-align:left;">
The Service is intended to provide you with all the necessary information to help you plan your trips to and within India better and simpler and also help you to compare the travel options.
1. Search engine + comparison platform for travel options<br/>
Eazzer shows you various travel options, which we identify for you, based on your preferences and needs. Eazzer aggregates and displays available travel options across multiple modes of travel (plane, train, bus) between the majority of cities in India in a simple and easy way. We arrange the results of your query by means of travel time and cost without any claim to completeness or accuracy. You then have the opportunity to compare these travel options upon duration, prices or other aspects. The list of the results of the query and its respective display or order does not endorse or even advertise for any travel option or a specific provider.<br/>
2. Booking via third-party services<br/>
On the result pages we offer a direct link to forward you to the booking pages of the respective providers. On their booking sites you can buy the appropriate tickets and make reservations.
The contract for the booked travel products (bookings and reservations) will solely be concluded between you and the relevant provider. Only the terms and conditions of the respective provider apply. Payment for such travel products will then processed solely by the provider via their respective payment system. Cancellations or change requests for such bookings must be conducted directly with those third-party providers.
We are not responsible for the availability of the travel product at the time of booking or for the performance of the booked travel product by the third party.

If any provision of these Terms and Conditions prove to be wholly or partially invalid or unenforceable, the validity of the remaining provisions or our contract with the user is not affected. Instead of the invalid Terms or Conditions a valid provision shall be replaced, that most closely approximates the economic purpose of the invalid provision. This also applies to the case of a loophole.
